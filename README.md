# Movie Recommendation System (TMDB)

This project implements a genre-based movie recommendation system using the TMDB movies metadata dataset. Users select a genre through an interactive Google Colab UI to receive top-rated movie recommendations with language, industry, rating, and release date.

Languages and film industries such as Hollywood, Bollywood, Tollywood, Kollywood, Marathi Cinema, Japanese Cinema, and European Cinema are derived from metadata for better clarity.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Google Colab
- ipywidgets
- TMDB Dataset (Kaggle)

## Features
- Genre-based movie recommendations
- Interactive UI in Google Colab
- Full language names instead of ISO codes
- Accurate industry classification
- Clean and reproducible data pipeline

## Dataset

## Usage
Open the notebook in Google Colab, upload the dataset ZIP or CSV file, run all cells, and select a genre from the dropdown to get movie recommendations.

## Purpose
